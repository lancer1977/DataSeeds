For example, a paladin who strikes an undead opponent with her conductive greatsword can expend two uses of her lay on hands ability (a supernatural melee touch attack) to deal both greatsword damage and damage from one use of lay on hands.

A lifesurge weapon boosts and sustains the wielder's life energy while he is in the throes of combat. The wielder gains a bonus on saving throws against necromantic effects—including the ability damage, ability drain, and energy drain powers of the undead—equal to the weapon's enhancement bonus. In addition, whenever the wielder receives temporary hit points from any source, he adds the weapon's enhancement bonus to these temporary hit points; this does not stack for temporary hit points from multiple sources, and these points are lost if the lifesurge weapon is not being wielded. In combat, the weapon's critical threat range is doubled against undead; this does not stack with the keen special ability or Improved Critical. Whenever a lifesurge weapon confirms a critical hit against an undead creature, it erupts with 1d8 points of positive energy (2d8 for weapons with a critical multiplier of ×3, 3d8 if it is ×4); the wielder may choose to deal this as damage to an undead target or to absorb half this amount as healing, with the remaining positive energy dissipating." },

Whenever a negating weapon damages a foe with DR/chaotic, DR/evil, DR/good, DR/lawful, or DR/magic, it reduces the value of that damage reduction by 5 points for 1 round. For example, a +1 negating lance hitting a creature with DR 10/good and lawful reduces the creature's DR to 5/good and lawful. If the creature has a component to its damage reduction other than the alignment types listed above, that component is unaffected. Thus, if the +1 negating lance above hits a demon with DR 10/good and cold iron, it would leave the demon with DR 10/cold iron and 5/good for 1 round. The effects of multiple negating weapons (or multiple hits from the same weapon) do not stack. This ability can only be placed on melee weapons." },

Once the spell has been cast from the weapon, a spellcaster can cast any other targeted spell of up to 3rd level into it. The weapon magically imparts to the wielder the name of the spell currently stored within it. A randomly rolled spell storing weapon has a 50% chance of having a spell stored in it already.

A spellstealing weapon allows its wielder to siphon protective magic from a target and transfer it to herself. When the wielder rolls a critical threat against a target, she can forgo confirming the critical hit and instead automatically learn which spells or magical effects are active upon the target. The wielder may then make a caster level check to steal her choice of one of those effects, using the spellstealing weapon's caster level plus its enhancement bonus, against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the effect. If the check succeeds, the target immediately loses the benefits of that effect and the wielder gains the effect for 1 minute (or until the effect expires, whichever comes first). If the spellstealing weapon has a critical multiplier greater than ×2, the wielder may attempt to steal one additional spell effect per additional multiple beyond ×2 (two effects for ×3, and so on)." },

This bonus damage is precision damage and only applies to the first successful hit against that creature. If the wielder attacks a creature other than the studied creature, commands the weapon to study a different creature, or ends her turn more than 60 feet from the studied creature, the weapon loses all bonus damage dice against the previously studied creature." },

A transformative weapon alters its shape at its wielder's command, becoming any other melee weapon of the same general shape and handedness; the weapon's categorization as simple, martial, or exotic is irrelevant. For example, a Medium transformative longsword can take the shape of any other Medium one-handed melee weapon, such as a scimitar, flail, or trident, but not a Medium light or two-handed melee weapon (such as a Medium short sword or a Medium greatsword). It can even take the shape of comparable weapons of different size categories. For example, a Small greatsword is a two-handed slashing weapon for a Small character, but is a one-handed slashing weapon for a Medium character, which is very similar to a Medium longsword; a Small transformative greatsword can thus become an actual Medium longsword, usable by a Medium creature without the –2 penalty for using a weapon of the wrong size. The weapon retains all of its abilities, including enhancement bonuses and weapon special abilities, except those prohibited by its current shape. For example, a keen transformative weapon functions normally in the form of a piercing or slashing weapon, but cannot use the keen special ability when in the shape of a bludgeoning weapon. When unattended, the weapon reverts to its true shape." },

Most other creatures, however, die when their heads are cut off. A vorpal weapon must be a slashing melee weapon. If you roll this special ability randomly for an inappropriate weapon, reroll." },
