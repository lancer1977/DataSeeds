Blood Focus,Standard Arcanist,1,,"the arcanist learns to harness the power of the magic in her blood to push the boundaries of her magic. The arcanist must select one school of magic and one sorcerer bloodline. Once selected, these choices cannot be changed. Whenever the arcanist casts a spell of her chosen school, using one of her arcanist spell slots, she can expend one use of her blood focus as a free action to bolster the spell. This adds 1 to the spell’s caster level and DC. The arcanist cannot expend more than one use of blood focus on a given casting of a spell. In addition, as a standard action an arcanist can expend one use of blood focus to use a bloodline power from her bloodline. She can use any one bloodline power that she would have access to, treating her arcanist levels as sorcerer levels. (The only except is that she cannot use the bloodline power granted at 20th level.) If the bloodline power is limited in its uses per day, she cannot use blood focus to use that bloodline power more times per day than she could if she were a sorcerer of the same level. If the bloodline power grants a permanent bonus (such as fire resistance or the ability to f ly), the arcanist gains this ability for a number of rounds equal to her arcanist level.

At each new arcanist level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new arcanist level) for her spellbook. At any time, an arcanist can also add spells found in other wizards’ spellbooks to her own (see Chapter 9 of the Core Rulebook). At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an arcanist learns an additional spell that’s derived from her bloodline, automatically adding these spells to her spellbook.",Arcanist,1,,,
Spells,Standard Arcanist,1,,"An arcanist casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, presented in Chapter 10 of the Core Rulebook. An arcanist must prepare her spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, her spells are not expended when they’re cast. Instead, she can cast any spell that she has prepared, assuming she hasn’t yet used up her spells per day for that level. To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the arcanist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The saving throw DC against an arcanist’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the arcanist’s Intelligence modifier. An arcanist can only cast a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1–1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1–3 in the Core Rulebook). An arcanist’s may know any number of spells, but the number she can prepare each day is limited. she can prepare four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells each day. At each new arcanist level, the number of spells she can prepare each day increases, adding new spell levels as indicated on Table 1–2. Unlike the number of spells she can cast per day, the number of spells an arcanist can prepare each day is not affected by her Intelligence score. Feats and other effects that modify the number of spells known by a spellcaster affect the number of spells the arcanist can prepare. An arcanist must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the arcanist decides what spells to prepare. Like a sorcerer, an arcanist can choose to apply a metamagic feat to a prepared spell as she casts it, increasing the casting time as normal. Like a wizard, she may prepare a spell with a metamagic feat, casting it using the normal casting time. She may combine these options, preparing a spell with a metamagic feat, then add another metamagic feat when she casts it by increasing the casting time.",Arcanist,1,,,

Bloodline,Standard Bloodrager,1,,"Each bloodrager has a source of magic somewhere in his heritage that empowers his bloodrages, bonus feats, and bonus spells. This source can represent a blood relation or an extreme event involving a creature somewhere in the family’s past. Regardless of the source, this inf luence manifests itself in a number of ways as the bloodrager gains level. A bloodrager must pick one bloodline upon taking his first level of bloodrager. Once made, this choice cannot be changed. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a bloodrager receives one bonus feat chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The bloodrager must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats. At 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th levels, a bloodrager learns an additional spell, derived from his bloodline. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table 1–4. These spells cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.",Bloodrager,0,,,
Bloodrage,Standard Bloodrager,1,,"Each bloodrager has a source of internal power somewhere in his heritage that grants him the ability to bloodrage. Starting a bloodrager can bloodrage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can bloodrage for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from bloodrage and spells like bear’s endurance, don’t increase the total number of rounds that a bloodrager can bloodrage per day. The total number of rounds of bloodrage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive. A bloodrager can enter a bloodrage as a free action. While in a bloodrage, a bloodrager gains a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saving throws. In addition, he takes a –2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the bloodrager 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in bloodrage, a bloodrager cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. A bloodrager can end his bloodrage as a free action. When the bloodrage ends, he’s fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage. A bloodrager cannot enter a new bloodrage while fatigued or exhausted, but otherwise can enter bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a bloodrager falls unconscious, his bloodrage immediately ends, placing him in peril of death. In addition, the bloodrage gains additional bloodrage powers 4th level, and every four levels thereafter. The bloodrage powers a bloodrager gains are based on his bloodline.

The saving throw DC against a bloodrager’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the bloodrager’s Charisma modifier. A bloodrager’s highest level of spells is 4th. Magus spells of 5th level and above are not on the bloodrager class spell list, and a bloodrager cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items (without making a successful Use Magic Device check) of magus spells of 5th level or higher. Like other spellcasters, a bloodrager can cast only a certain number of spells of each level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1–3. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 17, Table 1–3). The bloodrager does not need to prepare these spells in advance; he can cast them at any point during a bloodrage (as per his blood casting ability), assuming he hasn’t yet used up his spells per day for that level. The bloodrager’s selection of spells is limited. a bloodrager knows two 1st-level spells of the bloodrager’s choice at 4th level. A bloodrager gains more spells as he increases in level, as indicated on Table 1–4.

Raging Song,Standard Skald,1,,"A skald is trained to use the Perform skill to inspire allies (including himself, if so desired) to feats of strength and ferocity. He can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. At each level after 1st, a skald can use raging song for 1 additional round per day. Starting a raging song is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. A raging song cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the skald is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round to maintain it. A raging song counts as the bard’s bardic performance special ability for any effect that limits bardic performances, such as how many can be maintained at once. A raging song is language-dependent with audible components, but not visual components. Affected allies must be able to hear the skald for the song to have any effect. A deaf skald has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a raging song. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to raging songs. When the raging song begins, each ally within range must decide whether to accept or refuse the effects of the raging song (this is not an action); unconscious allies automatically accept the song. Once this choice is made, it lasts until the song ends or the ally moves out of range (returning to the area allows the ally to decide again); the raging allies cannot decide to end the rage on their own. Allies with 30 feet gain a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saves, but also take a –1 penalty to AC. While under the effects of skald rage, allies (other than the skald) cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. Affected allies are fatigued for 1 round after they’re no longer affected by the song (whether because the skald stops maintaining the song or because they’re no longer in range). At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, the song’s bonuses on Will saving throws increase by 1; the penalty to AC doesn’t change. At 8th and 16th levels, the song’s bonus to Strength and Constitution increase by 2. a skald can start a raging song as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a skald can start a raging song as a swift action.",Skald,1,,,

Rage Powers,Standard Skald,3,,"a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32–34 in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook) which affects the skald and any allies under the inf luence of his raging song. This cannot be a rage power that requiring the creature to spend a separate action to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose mighty swing (which requires an immediate action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack but otherwise does not require a separate action to activate). Unless otherwise noted, a skald cannot select an individual power more than once. When using raging song, the skald chooses which rage power to add to the song, and all affected allies gain the benefit of that rage power. The skald uses his skald level as his barbarian level for the purpose of selecting rage powers which require a minimum barbarian level. If a rage power can only be used a certain number of times per rage (such as no escape), each ally affected by the raging song can use the rage power once during the raging song. If the skald has a rage power from another source, he (but not his allies) can use those rage powers during a raging song. He cannot select a duplicate rage power, unless that rage power can be taken multiple times. If the skald has the ability to rage from another source, he can use his skald rage powers during that rage. The skald learns another rage power at 6th level and every three levels thereafter. He may add multiple rage powers from this ability to a raging song at the same time.",Skald,0,,,
Song of Marching,Standard Skald,3,,"At 3rd level, a skald can use raging song to inspire his allies to move faster without suffering from fatigue By expending 1 round of raging song, the skald invigorates allies within 60 feet, who may hustle for the next hour; this movement counts as a walk (not a hustle) for the purpose of accruing nonlethal damage and fatigue The skald must continue to perform the song for the remainder of the hour, otherwise its effects end, but only 1 round of raging song is expended for that hour",Skald,0,,,Su
Spell Kenning,Standard Skald,5,,"a skald is learned in magic of clerics and wizards, and can use his own magic in an inefficient, roundabout way to duplicate those classes’ spells. Once per day, a skald can cast any spell on the cleric or sorcerer/wizard spell list as if it were one of his skald’s spells known. Casting the spell requires the skald to expend two skald spell slots of that spell level or higher. If the desired spell normally requires 1 full round or longer to cast, the casting time for the skald increases by 1 full round per spell level; otherwise, the casting time is just 1 full round per spell level. (For example, if a skald wants to use spell kenning to cast mage armor, a 1stlevel sorcerer/wizard spell, he must spend 2 full rounds casting it and expend two skald spell slots of 1st level or higher.) a skald can use this ability twice per day.

Flurry of Blows,Unchained Monk,1,,"At 1st level, a monk can make a flurry of blows as a full-attack action. When making a flurry of blows, the monk can make one additional attack at his highest base attack bonus. This additional attack stacks with the bonus attacks from haste and other similar effects. When using this ability, the monk can make these attacks with any combination of his unarmed strikes and weapons that have the monk special weapon quality. He takes no penalty for using multiple weapons when making a flurry of blows, but he does not gain any additional attacks beyond what’s already granted by the flurry for doing so. (He can still gain additional attacks from a high base attack bonus, from this ability, and from haste and similar effects). 
 At 11th level, a monk can make an additional attack at his highest base attack bonus whenever he makes a flurry of blows. This stacks with the first attack from this ability and additional attacks from haste and similar effects.",Unchained Monk,,,,

This means that a monk can make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk can apply his full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes. A monk’s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, although he can choose to deal nonlethal damage with no penalty on his attack roll. He can make this choice while grappling as well.
A monk’s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.",Unchained Monk,,,,

Flawless Mind,Unchained Monk,19,,"At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. He is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than a humanoid (or whatever his original creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 10/chaotic, which allows him to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonchaotic weapon. Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if he were a member of his previous creature type. Finally, the monk gains the ability to enter a state of perfect calm. During this time, the monk can take no actions, but he does regain ki at the rate of 1 point per 10 minutes spent at calm. He cannot use this ability to gain an amount of ki in excess of his maximum.",Unchained Monk,,,,
