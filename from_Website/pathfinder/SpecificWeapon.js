The wielder of a blade of the rising sun may declare a sacrificial strike (similar to the retributive strike of a staff of power) as a standard action, or as an immediate action before losing consciousness upon gaining the dying or dead condition.

After an enemy has been sworn, the bow is treated as only a masterwork weapon against all foes other than the sworn enemy, and the archer takes a –1 penalty on attack rolls with any weapon other than the oathbow. These bonuses and penalties last for 7 days or until the sworn enemy is slain or destroyed by the wielder of the oathbow, whichever comes first. The oathbow may only have one sworn enemy at a time. Once the wielder swears to slay a target, he cannot make a new oath until he has slain that target or 7 days have passed.

A wielder can use the magic within a polarity hammer to attract or repel metal objects. In meteor mode, a wielder gains a +2 bonus on all drag and reposition combat maneuvers against any opponent wearing metal armor, carrying a metal shield, or made of metal (like an iron golem). In addition, if the wielder makes a successful trip attempt against such an opponent, she can push her enemy 5 feet away rather than pulling it forward. In fortress mode, the wielder can use a move action to pick up any unattended metal object within her reach and deposit the item in any other square within her reach. Items so affected cannot exceed the size of a one-handed weapon equal to the wielder's size category. In this mode, the +1 shield bonus to Armor Class normally granted from wielding a meteor hammer increases to +3, but only against opponents wearing metal armor, carrying metal shields, or made of metal (as above)." },

It glows with a faint green-yellow radiance when in use and can extend to nearly double its length, though only when being used to perform acrobatic feats. The wielder gains a +5 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks and can move at full speed without penalty when using Acrobatics to move on narrow surfaces or uneven ground. When making a high jump while wielding the quarterstaff of vaulting, the Acrobatics DC is equal to 3 times the height to be reached instead of 4. In addition, with a successful DC 25 Acrobatics check, the wielder can use the staff to vault over an opponent's head in place of taking a 5-foot step. She can only use this ability on creatures no more than one size category larger than her, and must end her movement in the nearest adjacent square on the opposite side of the creature. If this square is unavailable, she cannot use this ability. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity." },

{"Name":"Ricochet Hammer", "Aura":"Moderate Transmutation", "CL":"7th", "Craft":"Craft Magic Arms and Armor, telekinesis", "Price":"20,301 gp", "Field6":"2 lbs.", "Description":"This +1 returning light hammer can strike multiple foes with a single throw. If the wielder has multiple attacks from a high base attack bonus, he may throw the hammer so it rebounds off the first target to strike at a second target, and so on for each of the wielder's additional attacks. The distance to each target adds to the total range of the weapon, and range penalties apply. For example, a 6th-level dwarf fighter can throw the hammer using his +6 BAB at a target 20 feet away (within one range increment, no range penalty); if it hits, he ricochets it to attack using his +1 BAB at a second target 40 feet away from the first target (within three range increments for a –4 range penalty). The hammer can only ricochet if it successfully hits a target; if it misses, it stops ricocheting, has no further attacks that round, and returns as normal for a weapon with the returning property. Because ricocheting attacks are treated as separate attacks, modifiers that only apply to one attack roll (such as true strike) only apply to the first attack and not the others. The ricochet attacks count as the wielder's additional attacks for that round." },

Once each round when the summoner's sorrow damages a summoned or illusory creature, the wielder can make a dispel check as a free action to send away or destroy the creature. This is treated as a dispel magic spell targeted against the spell that created the creature, except that the wielder's base attack bonus is used in place of the wielder's or item's caster level. This ability has no effect on creatures that are called rather than summoned, or on summoned creatures that cannot be dispelled, such as a summoner's eidolon.

{"Name":"Sun Blade", "Aura":"Moderate Evocation", "CL":"10th", "Craft":"Craft Magic Arms and Armor, daylight, creator must be good", "Price":"50,335 gp", "Field6":"2 lbs.", "Description":"This sword is the size of a bastard sword. However, a sun blade is wielded as if it were a short sword with respect to weight and ease of use. In other words, the weapon appears to all viewers to be a bastard sword, and deals bastard sword damage, but the wielder feels and reacts as if the weapon were a short sword. Any individual able to use either a bastard sword or a short sword with proficiency is proficient in the use of a sun blade. Likewise, Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization in short sword and bastard sword apply equally, but the benefits of those feats do not stack. In normal combat, the glowing golden blade of the weapon is equal to a +2 bastard sword. Against evil creatures, its enhancement bonus is +4. Against Negative Energy Plane creatures or undead creatures, the sword deals double damage (and ×3 on a critical hit instead of the usual ×2). The blade also has a special sunlight power. Once per day, the wielder can swing the blade vigorously above his head while speaking a command word. The sun blade then sheds a bright yellow radiance that acts like bright light and affects creatures susceptible to light as if it were natural sunlight. The radiance begins shining in a 10-foot radius around the sword wielder and extends outward at 5 feet per round for 10 rounds thereafter, to create a globe of light with a 60-foot radius. When the wielder stops swinging the sword, the radiance fades to a dim glow that persists for another minute before disappearing entirely. All sun blades are of good alignment, and any evil creature attempting to wield one gains one negative level. The negative level remains as long as the sword is in hand and disappears when the sword is no longer wielded. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells) while the sword is wielded." },

The wielder of a ten-ring sword can use a full-round action to place a magic ring into the empty slot, where the ring then rests until removed (another full-round action). Once a ring is fitted to the tenth slot, the sword's wielder can employ that ring as if he were wearing it, even if he is currently wearing two magic rings. Alternatively, the sword's wielder can fit a ring made of a specific metal like adamantine or cold iron into the tenth slot. Doing so allows the sword to penetrate damage reduction as if it were made of the same metal as the ring. Using this property does not grant the weapon any additional properties of that metal (such as bypassing hardness, etc.). Typically, such metal rings cost one-tenth the cost of a nine-ring broadsword made from that material. In the event that a magic ring made from a specific metal, like silver, is affixed to the sword's tenth slot, the sword's wielder decides which of the weapon's two properties will be in effect when the ring is placed. However, the sword's wielder can use a move action to switch between properties." },

If the wielder remains in place and steps on the bar, he gains a +10 bonus to his CMD when trying to resist efforts to move him. The wielder is always considered braced against oncoming charge attacks.
