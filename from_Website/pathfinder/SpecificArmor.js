Each such creature must make a DC 16 Will saving throw to avoid suffering an overwhelming compulsion to attack the wearer for the next 7 rounds. If the creature is unable to attack the wearer on its next turn, or attacking the wearer would put the creature at risk (moving through a threatened square, charging into a pit, and so on) it can act normally that turn. This is a mind-affecting sonic effect, and has no effect on creatures that do not use a spoken language." },

On command, its wearer can vanish inside the armor, leaving the breastplate behind while she stays safely hidden in an extradimensional space. This space is barely large enough for the wearer to sit comfortably, but does provides breathable air and light to see by. The wearer cannot perceive the environs around the armor while inside. A second command word returns the wearer to the armor's location, wearing the armor. If the wearer can't return to the space the armor is in, she is instead shunted to the nearest empty space that can contain her, but no longer wearing the armor. If the breastplate is destroyed, the wearer immediately returns to the square the armor was in when it was destroyed.

Use of contagion requires a normal melee attack with the claws. The \"claws\" are built into the armor's vambraces and gauntlets, and cannot be disarmed. A suit of demon armor is infused with evil, and as a result it bestows one negative level on any nonevil creature wearing it.

Equestrian plate cannot transform and protect a mount more than one size larger than its wearer or a creature that cannot wear barding. It can create exotic barding, however, such as for a griffon or dragon. If extra enhancements or spells are placed upon equestrian plate in full plate form, they affect only the wearer's armor when the suit is split.

On command, the brooch transforms in a clatter of metallic plates and panels to instantly cover the wearer in a complete suit of +1 full plate, with the design of the brooch displayed on the armor's breastplate. The same command word causes the armor to transform into the brooch. The brooch only transforms if the wearer's armor slot is unoccupied, thus it won't work if the wearer is already armored.

While the wearer is enraged, spells that cause additional damage to evil outsiders deal that increased damage to her. A barbarian with fiend totem rage powers gains additional benefits from hamatula hide. If she has the lesser fiend totem rage power, she gains a +1 profane bonus to Armor Class while raging.

The armor itself disappears from view under this coat of scars and the wearer's face appears as a loathsome, eyeless veil of flesh. This change is illusory, similar to glamered armor; however, morlock hide does cause the wearer's arms and legs to extend and her posture to become hunched.

Creatures other than the wearer are repulsed by the otyugh armor's vile putridity. Any creature ending its turn adjacent to the wearer becomes sickened (Fortitude DC 13 negates) for as long as it remains adjacent to the wearer and for 1 round thereafter. A creature that strikes the wearer with a bite attack is affected the same way, even if it possesses exceptional reach and attacks while not adjacent to the wearer. If the wearer is swallowed whole, the attacker is automatically sickened and must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save at the beginning of its turn or be forced to regurgitate and drop the wearer harmlessly in an adjacent square (though the wearer is knocked prone during the regurgitation). Creatures with the scent ability suffer a –2 penalty to their saving throw against the stench of the otyugh armor. These abilities are poison effects; creatures immune to poison are immune to these effects as well. The wearer is immune to this effect. The wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on saves against disease, poison, and any effect that would cause her to become nauseated or sickened." },

A single color dominates the others at any given time. As a swift action, the wearer can change the dominant color. This color remains dominant until the wearer changes it again. When the wearer of prismatic plate is struck by a prismatic spray, or when he passes through a prismatic sphere or prismatic wall, he ignores the effect that matches the dominant armor color.

In addition, once per day on command, the wearer can transform the scarab breastplate into a swarm of scarab beetles that skitter from her chest to attack creatures nearby. This swarm has statistics identical to an army ant swarm and attacks any creatures within its space. The wearer can command the swarm to move (including changing the shape of the swarm) as a move action, but the swarm must remain adjacent to her. If the swarm is reduced to 0 hit points, if the wearer is forced to move away from the swarm, or if the wearer commands it to return to her as a move action, the swarm crawls back onto the wearer's torso and returns to armor form. While the swarm is active, the wearer is not considered to be wearing the scarab breastplate (except for purposes of commanding the swarm) and gains no defensive benefits from it. A druid of 6th level wearing a scarab breastplate can use her wild shape ability to duplicate vermin shape I. At 8th level, she can also use it to duplicate vermin shape II." },

Its design and coloration are typically suggestive of its related mystery. While wearing the armor, an oracle has access to that revelation and may use it as if she had it as a normal class feature. The oracle must have the appropriate mystery to use the armor; for example, a soothsayer's raiment (battlecry) is only usable by an oracle of battle. If the wearer already has that revelation and the revelation grants an ability with a limited number of uses per day, the oracle can use that ability one additional time per day. This ability has no effect if the armor is worn by a non-oracle.

This armor is treated in all ways like medium armor, including when determining proficiency. The armor has an arcane spell failure chance of 25%, a maximum Dexterity bonus of +2, and an armor check penalty of –4. As a move action, the wearer can snap a strip of wood loose from the armor. The strip lengthens into a weapon of a type chosen by the armor's wearer. It can become a +1 greenwood club, a +1/+1 greenwood quarterstaff, or a +1 keen greenwood wooden stake. If the wearer creates a club or quarterstaff in this way, it gains the benefits of the shillelagh spell with a duration of 1 minute. Each weapon removed from the warden of the woods reduces the armor's enhancement bonus by 1. Consequently, a maximum of three such weapons can be separated from the armor at any given time. The greenwood weapons keep their enhancement bonuses only while they're in the wearer's hands, though they remain masterwork weapons for other wielders. The wearer can reintegrate a weapon back into the warden of the woods as a move action and restore the lost enhancement bonus.

The wall acts as cover just like any physical wall. The wielder can touch the wall with one hand and command it to revert to a tower shield either resting on the ground and balanced against his hand or strapped to his arm in the normal fashion. The wall has all the characteristics of any other foot-thick wall of masonry (hardness 8, 90 hit points, break DC 35). Attacks sufficient to destroy the wall cause it to immediately transform back into a shield, which loses half its hit points and gains the broken condition.

When loosed into the air to defend its wearer, the belligerent shield attacks as well as defends. Each round starting the round after animation, the shield makes a single shield bash attack against a foe of its wearer's choice within the wearer's reach. This works as a standard shield bash attack using the wearer's normal attack bonus with the shield, except that the wearer retains the shield bonus to AC, and while the shield's attack is treated as an off-hand attack, the wearer does not take off-hand penalties on her own attacks unless she is fighting with two weapons herself.

The Reflex save DC to deflect such attacks is equal to 20 + the level of the spell (or 1/2 the class level or Hit Dice of the creature that created the effect, if a supernatural effect).

The cube has hardness 10 and 30 hit points per side. This cube grants the wearer total cover against everything outside the cube, including (as it is perfectly sealed) swarms and gas attacks. The inside of the cube is dark, and air cannot get in or out so the wearer must hold his breath starting on the third round after activating the cube. Attacks sufficient to destroy one side of the cube cause it to immediately transform back into a shield, which loses half its hit points and gains the broken condition. Otherwise, the cube reverts to shield form upon command, if the wearer moves from his current space, or if the wearer falls unconscious or dies." },
