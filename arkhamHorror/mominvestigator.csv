"The halls of Miskatonic University have been home to many accomplished scholars, and Amanda Sharpe was on track to be one of the institution’s most talented graduates. However, after seeing a strange painting of an enormous creature emerging from the ocean, her classwork has suffered. Her dreams are overwhelmed by images of a vast submerged city and the sounds of whispers in a language she does not understand.

He bunks with his loyal hound dog, Duke, on one side and his beat-up guitar on the other. And sometimes when “Ashcan” Pete sleeps, he dreams. He dreams of haunted, tortured places and of horrible creatures. When he wakes up, he knows that someone needs his help, because his dreams are true. He could not say how long he has been on the road, living by his wits, but he can say for certain no place is too far to go to help someone in need. And as long as Pete can help people, he is not likely to stop wandering any time soon."	https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/mansionsofmadness/images/6/6a/AshcanPete.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/120?cb=20150428123221

He may not be the biggest expert on forgotten cultures and secret societies, but he does know that rare books and antique weaponry can be sold for top dollar. More than once, he has discovered that an occult organization has been funded by gold coins of unknown origin, and Bob likes gold coins. He freely admits that he does not investigate arcane mysteries for noble reasons, but not many people are willing to face the horrors of the unknown.

Using a complex form of hypnosis, she studies the psychology of her patients through their dreams. Through this practice, she has seen and heard many disturbing things, but nothing prepared her for her most recent patient, Malachi. Following one of their more vivid and troublesome discussions of his dreams, Malachi was brutally murdered. As if that were not terrible enough, he was murdered with an ornate knife that he had described in one of his dreams. After hearing this news, Carolyn began reviewing her old notes concerning Malachi, anxious to find some kind of clue as to who he really was.

However, this is different. He had never seen something so terrible in his entire life, and he has cursed himself every day since for not having his camera on him to prove to everyone that he is not making this up. If they will not believe his words, maybe they will believe his pictures when they are published in the Arkham Advertiser.

And, most importantly, this time he will take pictures."	https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/mansionsofmadness/images/b/b4/DarrellSimmons.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/120?cb=20150428111522

"Dexter Drake returned from the Great War to become a successful magician, enthralling audiences with his elaborate illusions and cunning stage tricks. Despite his meteoric success, Dexter always longed to discover true magic. This desire soon led him into the reserved section of a dust-filled shop dedicated to obscure books. There, he found a burnt and torn fragment of the Necronomicon itself. Intrigued by this ancient piece of occult knowledge, Dexter began to use his wealth in search of the truth about ancient lore, and what he found horrified him. His delving into the arcane eventually led him to a variety of investigations, where he has discovered a great evil that will soon rise.

"Mateo Castile's life has not been easy, even—or perhaps especially—since finding his calling and becoming a priest. The past few decades in Mexico have been wracked with instability and conflict between a secular government and a traditional and religious populace. Father Mateo struggled to balance his faith with the pragmatic concerns of preaching when the law told him he must not. But as difficult as the political situation in Mexico has been, that is not what has assaulted Mateo's faith at its core. An investigation into a rash of murders and kidnappings in his home state led not to political violence as Mateo had suspected but to a gruesome and horrid cult thriving at the heart of the brewing war. How, Mateo wondered, could a kind and loving God allow what he saw that night to exist? His prayers are still unanswered, but Mateo now seeks answers on his own."	
10	Finn Edwards	The Bootlegger		3	3	4	3	4	4	8	6		"Once per round, you may move 1 space before or after performing a Search Action."	"Prohibition was the best thing that ever happened to Finn Edwards. Until they banned alcohol, he was just drifting through life, doing odd jobs here and there. But afterwards, the demand for alcohol rose to such a fever pitch that he was able to make a comfortable living evading the law and giving people what they wanted. His new lifestyle particularly suited his personality, providing him with a taste of danger, plenty of cash, and a great deal of personal satisfaction. Of course, those things are all well and good until you find yourself running through the woods at night trying to lose a bunch of knife-wielding maniacs who want to sacrifice you to their dark gods. Although Finn has never been a vengeful man, that incident left him rattled in ways he hadn't been since getting beaten up on the playground years ago. Stepping out of the bank with enough borrowed cash for guns and supplies, Finn vows that those lunatics will regret the day they ever crossed him"

She eventually learned to overcome the terror that accompanied these visions by writing them into stories. As the years went by, her stories launched her into a successful career as an author, but the more she wrote, the more extreme the visions became. She has come to believe that the images she sees are not her imagination, but rather clairvoyant insight into the world of the supernatural. She has resolved to use this insight to investigate the realm of the supernatural and exorcise these nightmares from the world as well as her subconscious."	https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/mansionsofmadness/images/d/dc/GloriaGoldberg.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/404?cb=20150428124021

"Jenny Barnes has spent the majority of her young life in pursuit of creature comforts, fine dining, and the latest fashions. But during her most recent summer in Paris, she received a letter from her sister, Isabelle. In this letter, Isabelle confessed that mysterious forces were aligning against her and that she feared she may fall victim to some paranormal threat. It was the last letter Jenny received from her beloved sister. Jenny has since returned to the States to track down and investigate all occult occurrences she can find.

14	Jim Culver	The Musician		3	3	3	4	4	4	6	8	Golden Trumpet		"Daddy used to say, ""Jazz is a lot like liquor, it makes everything go down a little smoother."" Daddy used to say a lot of stupid things. Jazz has been nothing but trouble for Jim since the day he picked up his daddy's trumpet. There was something weird and otherworldly about the writing on the inside of the bell, but the tones from it were smooth and dark, like good coffee. There was something about it that made you want to tap your feet and snap your fingers. That trumpet landed Jim a lot of gigs until the time it made Widow Jenkins get up and dance, the day he played at her funeral. After that, it was kind of hard to find work, especially playing funerals. Since then, Jim has learned a lot about jazz—and the things the graveyard ghouls talk about on cold autumn nights. Lately, they've been talking about The End, as in the end of everything that is and could be. The Final Rhapsody. The fact is, Jim isn't too keen on that idea. He's got more songs he wants to play before then. So, sitting in a booth at Velma's, Jim takes one last swallow of hot coffee before heading out to play what could be his last encore. The coffee is smooth and dark going down, just like the night..."

A weaker mind might have gone mad or dismissed the sight as a hallucination.

Mandy, however, objectively recorded her findings and was seemingly able to shake off the damaging effects of the books. She believes she has seen a pattern emerging from the various texts which indicates an impending cataclysm. She recognizes that it may simply be an imagined paranoia resulting from her reading, but she truly believes that a disaster of epic proportions is on the horizon and that she must do everything she can to prevent it from coming to pass."	https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/mansionsofmadness/images/7/7e/MandyThompson.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/120?cb=20150428104857

Today, Rita spent several hours trying to convince the police to do something, but the Sheriff says that his hands are tied without more evidence. Still, while running away might be the best way to avoid this premonition of personal doom hanging over her, that's never been Rita's style. Whether her stalkers are members of the Klu Klux Klan or something even more sinister, she's going to face them head on, the same way she's been facing the world all her life."
