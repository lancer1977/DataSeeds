He bunks with his loyal hound dog, Duke, on one side and his beat-up guitar on the other. And sometimes when Ashcan Pete sleeps, he dreams. He dreams of haunted, tortured places and of horrible creatures. When he wakes up, he knows that someone needs his help, because his dreams are true. He could not say how long he has been on the road, living by his wits, but he can say for certain no place is too far to go to help someone in need. And as long as Pete can help people, he is not likely to stop wandering any time soon."

Through this practice, she has seen and heard many disturbing things, but nothing prepared her for her most recent patient, Malachi. Following one of their more vivid and troublesome discussions of his dreams, Malachi was brutally murdered. As if that were not terrible enough, he was murdered with an ornate knife that he had described in one of his dreams.

The past few decades in Mexico have been wracked with instability and conflict between a secular government and a traditional and religious populace.

But as difficult as the political situation in Mexico has been, that is not what has assaulted Mateo's faith at its core. An investigation into a rash of murders and kidnappings in his home state led not to political violence as Mateo had suspected but to a gruesome and horrid cult thriving at the heart of the brewing war. How, Mateo wondered, could a kind and loving God allow what he saw that night to exist? His prayers are still unanswered, but Mateo now seeks answers on his own."

There was something weird and otherworldly about the writing on the inside of the bell, but the tones from it were smooth and dark, like good coffee. There was something about it that made you want to tap your feet and snap your fingers. That trumpet landed Jim a lot of gigs until the time it made Widow Jenkins get up and dance, the day he played at her funeral. After that, it was kind of hard to find work, especially playing funerals. Since then, Jim has learned a lot about jazzand the things the graveyard ghouls talk about on cold autumn nights.
