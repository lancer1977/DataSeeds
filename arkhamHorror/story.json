    "Story": "Rex Murphy didn't believe in luck, which was good, since he had none. He didn't believe the old woman in Romania who'd told him he was cursed, either. But he had to admit that things went wrong for him more often than they went right, and sometimes in disastrous ways. He'd lost count of the times he had found concrete evidence of the \"hidden world,\" only to have it blow away in the wind, or be ruined by rain, or eaten by a rhinoceros. But luck couldn't be proved, couldn't be printed in the Arkham Advertiser, and so Rex told himself he didn't believe in it. But if he had his way, everyone would believe the hidden world was real. ",

    "Story": "Although a great lover of wealth and comfort, Jenny always had a curious and adventurous streak. While she adored the fashion and society of Paris and Venice, she was equally at home sport-shooting in rural Scotland or trawling the jazz clubs of New Orleans. She'd even funded an archaeological dig of her own, just for the fun of being the first one into the old tomb. So when she learned that her sister Isabelle was missing, Jenny came to Arkham to handle the matter herself. Perhaps a life of wealth and power had made her overconfident... or perhaps the rogues who'd taken her sister had made their last mistake. ",

So, when his data showed that the universe was ending, he calmly and reasonably examined the situation and checked his results. There was no mistake: six stars had simply vanished, and something impossible was moving in the void. Although the scientific community dismissed his research as the ramblings of a crackpot, Norman continued his studies, approaching the problem with the same rationality he had always used. So what if his studies were now of forgotten ancient lore, and even magic? He was still a rational man.",
